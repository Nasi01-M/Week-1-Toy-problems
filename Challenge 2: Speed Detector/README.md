Speed Detector - A JavaScript Toy Program
This simple JavaScript program acts as a toy speed detector, offering feedback on driving speed and potential consequences.

Features:
Takes the car's speed as input (e.g., 80 km/h).
Checks if the speed is below the limit of 70 km/h.
For speeds exceeding the limit:
Calculates the number of demerit points based on exceeding speed in 5 km/h increments.
Informs the driver of the earned demerit points.
Triggers a "License suspended!" message if points exceed 12.
Outputs "Ok" for speeds within the limit.

Usage:
Clone the repository or download the files.
Open the index.html file in your browser.
Enter the car's speed in the prompt.
The program will display your speed status and any potential demerits/suspension details.
